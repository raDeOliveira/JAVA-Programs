JAVA-Priority Heap-Array

# Java-BinaryTree-WordCount
Another great program without using java collections.

# In this repository i build a max binary tree map with classes:

* Node;
* Main;
* FileClass (nice class to avoid File class from Java);
* Read class (to avoid Scanner import);

# The main goal
* store the founded chars on the max binary tree;
* store the char occurrence/frequency on a Node;
* the result will print the desired number of chars with max occurrence by using remove method from heap;

# Methods you will find
* insertNode;
* insert;
* upHeap;
* toHeap;
* heapSort;
* downHeap;
* print;
* remove;
* countedChar;
* mainCode;
* duplicatesChar;
