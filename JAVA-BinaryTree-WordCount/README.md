# Java-BinaryTree-WordCount
Another great program without using java collections.

# In this repository i build a binary tree map with classes:

* Node;
* Binary tree;
* FileClass (nice class to avoid File class from Java);
* Read class (to avoid Scanner import);

# The main goal
* store the founded words on the tree;
* store the line number where words appears in an ArrayList;
* stores the repetitions of the word on binary tree;

# Methods you will find
* insertNode;
* Search word;
* count nodes;
* count left and right side nodes;
* count tree levels;
* print the line number where word appears;
* count the word repetitions;
* total characters count;
* total different words;
* total word sin text;
* pre order tree view
* in order tree view;
* pos order tree view;
